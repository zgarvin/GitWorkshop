# Getting a Git Repo

-   Creating a repo from a directory:
    
        git init
-   Cloning a repo:
    
        git clone repo_url

# adding a change to this file to see what happens

# now I am modifying again now that this file is staged
	# it goes back to the modified state!
	# the other changes that we added when we "added" are still staged, but these new stages are not
